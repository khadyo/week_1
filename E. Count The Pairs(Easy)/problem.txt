Given an array of N
 numbers, count the number of ordered pairs of indices i,j
 such that i≠j
 , 1≤i<j≤N
 and a[i]+a[j]==min(a)+max(a)
 i.e. the sum of those two numbers equals the sum of both the minimum and maximum numbers in the array.

Input
The first line of input contains one integer N
 such that 1≤N≤5000
 the number of elements in the array The second line contains N
 space-separated integers each 1≤a[i]≤109
Output
print the answer in one line, the number of ordered pairs of indices such that the sum of their two values equals the sum of the maximum + minimum numbers in the given array.
